# üéì **BLOCKCHAIN CHARITY PLATFORM - VIVA EXAMINATION GUIDE**

## üìã **PROJECT OVERVIEW**

### **System Architecture**

Your blockchain charity platform consists of:

1. **Smart Contracts (Solidity)**

   - `CharityRegistry.sol` - Manages charity registration and approval
   - `DonationPlatform.sol` - Handles donations, fund requests, and withdrawals
   - `CharityToken.sol` - ERC-20 token for platform transactions

2. **Frontend (React.js)**

   - Modern React 18 application with Bootstrap UI
   - Web3 integration using ethers.js v6
   - Real-time blockchain interaction

3. **Development Environment**
   - Hardhat for smart contract development
   - Local blockchain network for testing
   - MetaMask integration for wallet connectivity

## üîß **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS**

### **1. Smart Contract Architecture**

#### **CharityRegistry.sol**

```solidity
// Key Features:
- Charity registration system
- Admin approval mechanism
- Status management (Pending, Approved, Rejected)
- OpenZeppelin Ownable for access control
```

**Core Functions:**

- `registerCharity()` - Self-registration for charities
- `updateCharityStatus()` - Admin approval/rejection
- `isCharityApproved()` - Status verification
- `getAllCharities()` - Retrieve all registered charities

#### **DonationPlatform.sol**

```solidity
// Key Features:
- ETH and ERC-20 token donations
- Fund request system for charities
- Withdrawal mechanism with approval workflow
- Usage reporting for transparency
- Reentrancy protection using OpenZeppelin ReentrancyGuard
```

**Core Functions:**

- `donateETH()` - Direct ETH donations
- `donateToken()` - ERC-20 token donations
- `createFundRequest()` - Charity fund requests
- `updateFundRequestStatus()` - Admin approval
- `withdrawFunds()` - Approved fund withdrawal
- `submitFundUsageReport()` - Post-withdrawal reporting

#### **CharityToken.sol**

```solidity
// Standard ERC-20 implementation
- Fixed supply of 1,000,000 tokens
- Standard transfer, approve, allowance functions
- OpenZeppelin ERC20 base contract
```

### **2. Security Implementations**

#### **Reentrancy Protection**

```solidity
// Using OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard
modifier nonReentrant
```

**Explanation:** Prevents malicious contracts from calling functions repeatedly before state updates complete.

#### **Access Control**

```solidity
// Owner-only functions using OpenZeppelin Ownable
modifier onlyOwner
```

**Explanation:** Ensures only authorized admin can approve charities and fund requests.

#### **Input Validation**

```solidity
require(_amount > 0, "Donation amount must be greater than 0");
require(_charityAddress != address(0), "Invalid charity address");
```

### **3. Frontend Architecture**

#### **Web3 Integration Layers**

1. **Provider Layer** - MetaMask connection
2. **Signer Layer** - Transaction signing
3. **Contract Layer** - Smart contract instances
4. **UI Layer** - React components
5. **State Management** - React hooks
6. **Error Handling** - User-friendly error messages
7. **Transaction Tracking** - Real-time status updates

#### **Key Components**

- `App.js` - Main application with Web3 initialization
- `Navigation.js` - Wallet connection display
- `DonationForm.js` - ETH and token donation interface
- `CharityList.js` - Display and manage charities
- `CharityRegistration.js` - Self-registration form
- `FundRequests.js` - Request management (placeholder)
- `UsageReports.js` - Transparency reporting (placeholder)

## üìö **EXAMINATION TALKING POINTS**

### **1. Blockchain Fundamentals**

**Q: Why blockchain for charity platforms?**
**A:**

- **Transparency:** All transactions are publicly verifiable
- **Immutability:** Donation records cannot be altered
- **Decentralization:** Reduces single points of failure
- **Smart Contracts:** Automated, trustless execution
- **Global Access:** No geographical restrictions

### **2. Smart Contract Design Decisions**

**Q: Explain the two-phase donation system**
**A:**

1. **Phase 1:** Donors contribute to charity pool
2. **Phase 2:** Charities request funds with justification
3. **Approval:** Admin reviews and approves legitimate requests
4. **Withdrawal:** Funds released to charity's wallet
5. **Reporting:** Usage transparency through reports

**Q: Why separate Registry and Platform contracts?**
**A:**

- **Separation of Concerns:** Registry handles identity, Platform handles transactions
- **Modularity:** Each contract has single responsibility
- **Upgradability:** Can upgrade one without affecting the other
- **Gas Optimization:** Smaller contracts = lower deployment costs

### **3. Security Considerations**

**Q: How do you prevent reentrancy attacks?**
**A:**

```solidity
function withdrawFunds() public nonReentrant {
    // State changes before external calls
    charityBalances[msg.sender] -= amount;

    // External call after state update
    (bool success,) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: amount}("");
    require(success, "Transfer failed");
}
```

**Q: What access controls are implemented?**
**A:**

- **OnlyOwner:** Admin functions (charity approval, fund request approval)
- **OnlyCharity:** Withdrawal functions restricted to registered charities
- **Public Functions:** Donations open to all users

### **4. Gas Optimization Techniques**

**Q: How did you optimize for gas efficiency?**
**A:**

- **Efficient Data Types:** Using `uint256` for compatibility
- **Minimal Storage:** Avoiding unnecessary state variables
- **Batch Operations:** Processing multiple items together
- **Events Over Storage:** Using events for historical data

### **5. Frontend Integration Challenges**

**Q: How does the frontend interact with smart contracts?**
**A:**

1. **Web3 Detection:** Check for MetaMask availability
2. **Network Verification:** Ensure correct blockchain network
3. **Contract Loading:** Import ABIs and addresses
4. **Signer Binding:** Attach user's wallet for transactions
5. **Transaction Handling:** Manage pending/success states
6. **Error Processing:** Parse blockchain errors for users

### **6. Testing and Deployment**

**Q: How do you test smart contracts?**
**A:**

- **Unit Tests:** Test individual functions with Hardhat
- **Integration Tests:** Test contract interactions
- **Gas Analysis:** Monitor transaction costs
- **Security Audits:** Check for vulnerabilities
- **Local Network Testing:** Hardhat local blockchain
