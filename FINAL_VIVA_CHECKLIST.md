## 🔧 TECHNICAL DEEP DIVE PREPARATION

### 🏗️ **Smart Contract Architecture**

Be prepared to explain:

**CharityRegistry.sol**

```solidity
// Core functions to highlight:
- registerCharity(string name, string description, string category)
- getCharityInfo(address charity)
- totalCharities()
```

**DonationPlatform.sol**

```solidity
// Key features:
- donate(address charity) payable
- createFundRequest(uint amount, string purpose, string category)
- approveFundRequest(address charity, uint requestId)
- getCharityBalance(address charity)
```

**CharityToken.sol (ERC20)**

```solidity
// Token mechanics:
- Mint tokens to donors (1:1 ratio with ETH donated)
- Incentivize continued participation
- Proof of donation history
```

### 🔐 **Security Features**

Highlight these security implementations:

- **ReentrancyGuard**: Prevents reentrancy attacks
- **Ownable**: Access control for admin functions
- **Input validation**: Prevents zero addresses and invalid data
- **Fund escrow**: Donations held until approved release

### 🌐 **Frontend Technology Stack**

Be ready to discuss:

- **React.js**: Component-based UI framework

## 💡 ADVANCED QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

### Q: "How does your platform prevent charity fraud?"

**A:** "Multiple mechanisms: 1) Charities must register with verified information, 2) All donations are held in escrow, 3) Fund requests require admin approval, 4) All transactions are publicly auditable on the blockchain"

### Q: "What happens if a charity misuses funds?"

**A:** "The platform includes usage reporting requirements and fund request approval workflows. Additionally, all transactions are transparent, allowing donors and regulators to audit fund usage"

### Q: "How scalable is this solution?"

**A:** "Built on Ethereum, it can handle thousands of transactions. For higher scalability, it could be deployed on Layer 2 solutions like Polygon or Arbitrum"

### Q: "What about gas fees for small donations?"

**A:** "This is a consideration. Solutions include: 1) Batch donations, 2) Layer 2 deployment, 3) Gasless meta-transactions for small donors"
